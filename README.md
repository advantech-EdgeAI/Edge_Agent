## Short Video Tutorial

Our short video tutorial walks through the steps for installaion and configuration.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zty0kBugyQs"><img src="./images/media/install_tutorial.gif"></a>

## 0. Clone this Repository

Clone this repository to your Jetpack 6 device:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/advantech-EdgeAI/edge_agent.git
```

## 1. Docker Service Installation 
Starting from JetPack 6, the SDK Manager does not install Docker service by default.

### Checking on Docker Service
Check the Docker version to ensure that the Docker service is installed and running properly on your system:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker is not available, run the following script to install and enable it on your JetPack 6 device:

```bash
bash init-dockerd-jetson-jp6.sh
```

##  2. (Optional) Setup Extended Storage - NVMe SSD
üîî *If your root filesystem (`/`) has more than 200 GB of free storage, you can skip this step and proceed to the 'Download Essential Data' section.*

### Physical Installation
1. Power off your Jetson device and disconnect peripherals.
2. Insert the NVMe SSD into the carrier board, ensuring it's properly seated and secured.
3. Reconnect peripherals and power on the device.
4. Verify the SSD is recognized by running:

   ```bash
   lspci
   ```

   You should see an entry similar to:
   ```
   0007:01:00.0 Non-Volatile memory controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Device 1322 (rev 02)
   ```

### Create ext4 Filesystem on SSD and Mount it to `/ssd` by Default
 - Follow the 'Format and Set Up Auto-Mount' section in this [link](https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/tips_ssd-docker.html#format-and-set-up-auto-mount).

### Migrate Docker Directory to SSD
 - Follow the 'Migrate Docker Directory SSD' section in this [link](https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/tips_ssd-docker.html#migrate-docker-directory-to-ssd).

### Verifying Newly Installed SSD

 You can follow these ***optional*** steps to verify that the SSD is configured correctly for Docker images and disable Apport reporting:

- [Test Docker on SSD](https://github.com/advantech-EdgeAI/edge_agent/wiki/Test-Docker-on-SSD)
- [Disable Apport Reporting](https://github.com/advantech-EdgeAI/edge_agent/wiki/Disable-Apport-Reporting)

## 3. Download Essential Data

Run the following script to download Docker images and the necessary packages:

```bash
bash download-EA-JC-2ssd.sh
```

## 4. Start Edge Agent

Start the Edge Agent, and the backend will listen on port 8050 on localhost:

```bash
bash startEA.sh
```

## 5. Start Working on Edge Agent Through Web UI

Once the Edge Agent starts up successfully, open another terminal to launch the web browser (Chromium):

```bash
bash launch-chromium.sh
```

At this stage, you should have successfully started the Edge Agent and accessed it via Chromium. You can also start the service by following the steps in the next section.

## (Optional) Start Edge Agent Manually

Start the Edge Agent container without the HuggingFace token:

   ```bash
   sudo jetson-containers run \
   -v /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id \
   -v /:/dummy_root:ro \
   -v ${your-edge-agent-folder}:/opt/NanoLLM \
   -v ${your-edge-agent-folder}/pre_install/project_presets:/data/nano_llm/presets \
   ispsae/nano_llm:24.7-r36.2.0_bug_fixed \
   python3 -m nano_llm.studio
   ```

Or start it with the HuggingFace token:

1. Register on HuggingFace - Sign up on HuggingFace and obtain an access token (in the Settings section).

   ![](./images/media/image3.png)

   *Remember to replace the HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN value with your own.*

   ```bash
   sudo jetson-containers run --env HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_xyz123abc456 \
   -v /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id \
   -v /:/dummy_root:ro \
   -v ${your-edge-agent-folder}:/opt/NanoLLM \
   -v ${your-edge-agent-folder}/pre_install/project_presets:/data/nano_llm/presets \
   ispsae/nano_llm:24.7-r36.2.0_bug_fixed \
   python3 -m nano_llm.studio
   ```

2. Once the service starts on your device, open a browser (Chromium) and navigate to https://IP_ADDRESS:8050 (Note: Do NOT use Firefox).

Here are a few important notes:

- Use the `--load` option to load your prebuilt pipeline before starting.
- If the program crashes, it will automatically restore the most recent pipeline you created.
- A "clear memory" function is available, allowing you to reset the system state.

To create a new project, click on the "Agent New Project" button in the top-right corner of Edge Agent. You‚Äôll be given the option to either keep or discard the current pipeline before starting the new one.

Alternatively, you can visit https://IP_ADDRESS:8050/reload in your browser. After about 15 seconds, log back into https://IP_ADDRESS:8050. Either method will return your system to its initial state.
